## Task 1
### Part A
Firstly asteroids are constantly checking to see if they should be spawned. The asteroids should be pooled I.E. The number of asteroids that can be spawned should be capped, and a request should be made when you go below that number.
The asteroids that are spwaning can have a velocity away from the screen. Asteroids also aren't deleting themselves if they're off screen. Same with bullets.
